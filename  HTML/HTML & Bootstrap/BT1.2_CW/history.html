        <p class="fs-5 fw-light">  The Taj Mahal was built between 1631 and 1648 is the result of the profound love Emperor Shah Jahan had for his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Mumtaz Mahal died during child birth. It took over 20,000 workers and artisans to complete this significant structure.</p>
        <p class="fs-5 fw-light">The Taj Mahal is a testament to the artistry of Mughal architecture and has a rich history, including surviving wars and natural disasters.</p>
